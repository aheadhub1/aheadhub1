CYBER SECURITY ANALYST|PEN TESTER|WEB DEVELOPER
I am an enthusiastic and detail-oriented Cybersecurity professional with a strong foundation in digital risk management, network protection, and cloud security. With hands-on training through government-backed programs like the 3MTT Cybersecurity Track, Tech4Dev's Digital for All initiative, and Google’s Professional Cybersecurity Certification, I’ve built practical skills in identifying threats, analyzing vulnerabilities, and securing systems using industry tools such as Nmap, Wireshark, and Google Cloud IAM.
My passion lies in helping individuals and organizations stay secure in an increasingly connected world. I believe in continuous learning, ethical responsibility, and clear communication as the cornerstones of effective cybersecurity. I am currently focused on growing my expertise in cloud infrastructure security and threat intelligence while seeking opportunities to contribute meaningfully as a junior analyst, SOC analyst, or IT security support professional.
